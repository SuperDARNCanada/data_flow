# A singleton script to copy the data FILES to the on-site linux computer, removing them locally after
# a successful copy. Dependencies include 'jq' (installed via zypper), 
# as well as BOREALISPATH and SITE_LINUX being in the environment variables in $HOME/.profile
#
# The script should be run via crontab like so:
# 8,45 */2 * * * . $HOME/.profile; $HOME/data_flow/rsync_to_linux.sh >> $HOME/rsync_to_linux.log 2>&1

# What is this script called?
SCRIPT_NAME=`basename "$0"`
DEST=/borealis_nfs/borealis_data/daily/
# Use jq with the raw output option and the Borealis directory to get the source for the data
SOURCE=`cat ${BOREALISPATH}/config.ini | jq -r '.data_directory'`
# The following constant is how many minutes threshold the script will use to find FILES
# to move to the site linux computer. This is so that the script doesn't try to move the current data
# file being written to.

# A temp directory for rsync to use in case rsync is killed, it will start up where it left off
TEMPDEST=.rsync_partial
